    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yoghurt</li>
      <li>1.5 lb / 750 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated</li>
      <li>
        1 tsp tumeric powder 2 tsp garam masala 1/2 tsp chilli powder or cayenne
        pepper powder(Spices)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and
        refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take
        the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the
        marinade from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl
        into the fry pan).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the
        chicken is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the
        Marinade).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining
        marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
        Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice
        or roti(flat bread).
      </li>
      <li>Voila!! Enjoy!</li>
