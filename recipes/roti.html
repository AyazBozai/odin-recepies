    <p>
      Roti is a super easy and delicious Indian flatbread. It is amazing when
      served with curry, totally perfect for sopping up extra sauce! I have all
      the tips you need to make sure this Indian bread turns out super soft. I
      will show you just how to make roti, step by step!

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bread flour. You can substitute all-purpose flour in a pinch, but your
        roti won’t be as chewy.
      </li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add some salt to your bread flour and whisk it together. Traditional
        roti is unsalted, but I’m sorry, I just can’t.
      </li>
      <li>
        After whisking your flour and salt together, pour in about 2 tablespoons
        butter and cut it in with a fork. This makes your bread extra tender and
        adds great flavor! Oil or ghee will work fine too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next add some warm water. Use the same fork to stir it all together
        until a dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead for about 8 minutes. You can do it by hand or use a stand mixer.
        As you knead, all that protein in your flour is going to combine to form
        strands of gluten, making your dough nice and strong and able to be
        rolled out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one piece and flatten it out into a disk with your fingers. Use a
        rolling pin to roll the dough out into a circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pan is nice and hot, add about a teaspoon of butter to the pan
        and swirl it around. Carefully transfer your rolled out roti to the hot
        pan and then count for about 6-7 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Flip!Voilaa!!Enjoy!!!</li>
