    <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy
      marinated chicken, caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice. For my
      Biryani, I simplify the order of operations, while retaining the
      traditional layered approach to assembling it.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg aged basmati rice</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 kg chicken thighs, skin off</li>
      <li>200ml peanut oil for frying</li>
      <li>4 tbsp yoghurt</li>
      <li>3 large red onions, sliced thin</li>
      <li>spices, salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by making the crispy onions by heating up the oil in a saucepan
        over a medium high heat and frying the sliced onions in batches until
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, marinate your chicken by adding the chicken, 1/3 of the crispy
        onions, yoghurt, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, ginger, garlic,
        lemon juice, one cinnamon stick, 8 cardamom pods, 1 green chilli sliced
        thin, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 4 cloves, chopped mint and coriander and a tsp
        of salt in a large pot. Mix well and marinate for 4-24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the soaked rice to the simmering water, stir once and cook for 6-8
        minutes or until its just cooked. You still want a bit of bite in the
        rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove half of the chicken, then sprinkle half of the rice on the
        chicken in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the rest of the chicken and repeat with the rice, crispy onions
        and herbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn your element to medium high for 10 minutes, then turn it down to
        very low for 30 minutes. Take from the heat and let it rest for 20
        minutes before taking the lid off and serving.
      </li>
      <li>Voila!!Enjoy!!</li>
